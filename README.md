# numerical analysis of particulate cytoplasmic inheritance 
Initial code to get a project on particulate cytoplasmic inheritance on its way. 

## Installing GSL
Prior to building the executable below, one needs to install the
GNU scientific library (`libgsl`) within your local directory. This contains some
nifty functions to calculate binomial densities and coefficients.

See [here](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/jild13/2016/07/11/hello/) for instructions how to install the GNU Scientific Library

## How to run
```
git clone https://github.com/bramkuijper/particulate_cytoplasmic.git

cd particulate_cytoplasmic

make

./biparental.exe
```
